This is one of my master's projects; It's the practice of text mining in a data set provided by the TripAdvisor website.
The aim of the project is to cluster customers on the basis of their comments left on the website.
The project is done via Python3 and Pycharm IDE.
Unfortunately, I was not allowed to share the data set, but all the steps and data features are described thoroughly in the report file I have shared.
I have also added the English transcript of the report.
