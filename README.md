This is one of my master's project; It's practise of text mining in a data set provided by TripAdvisor web site.
The aim of the project is to cluster customers on the basis of their comments left on the website.
The project is done via Python3 and pycharm IDE.
Unfortunaltely, I was not allowed to share the data set, but all the steps and data features are describe thorougly in the report file I have shared.
